    <h2>It was common in Victorian England for children to be employed in the workforce. Some were expected to work from as young as 4 years old.<br><br>Orphans and children from poor families would be taken on as mill apprentices. These children didn’t get paid for their labour, with mill owners believing that basic food and a place to sleep were payment enough.<br><br>However, these children would be tasked with some of the most dangerous jobs within the mill. Being small meant they could do jobs adults couldn’t, such as cleaning under moving machinery, with many children tragically losing their lives undertaking these dangerous tasks.<br><br>They would work 12 -14 hours a day and be exposed to brutal discipline if they made mistakes, were late for work or, through sheer exhaustion, were caught falling asleep at their machines.<br><br>Punishments included beatings, heavy weights tied around their necks, or even having their ears nailed to tables.</h2>

    <h1>ABOUT THE DATASET</h1>
    <h2>This dataset is from <img src="https://ourworldindata.org/owid-logo.svg" id="owid" width="30" height="22" /> Our world in Data and provides data on working hours.<br><br>These datasets provide a comprehensive perspective on the global workforce. They cover data ranging from annual working hours to GDP per capita, as well as information on work efficiency and employee benefits. By comparing data across different countries and periods, one can explore the relationship between labor hours, economic output, and productivity. Additionally, the datasets include information on vacation days and public holidays, which is crucial for understanding labor policies in various countries and their impact on workers’ quality of life. Overall, these datasets are important tools for understanding how labor patterns evolve and how they affect the broader socio-economic structure.</h2>

    <h1>WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS TOPIC?</h1>

<div id="page7" class="pagee">
    <h2><br><br><br>"We must free people from the heavy physical labor," I said. "We must lighten their yokes, give them a breather, so they do not spend their entire lives by the stoves, troughs, and in the fields, but also have time to think about the soul, about God, and could broadly apply their spiritual abilities. Every person's calling lies in spiritual activity, in the constant search for truth and the meaning of life. Make coarse, animal-like labor unnecessary for them, let them feel free, and then you will see what a mockery these books and medicine chests are. Once a person realizes their true calling, only religion, science, and art can satisfy them, not these trifles."<br><br>Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, <i>The House with the Mezzanine</i></h2>

<div id="page6" class="pagee">
    <h1>Work is a central part of our lives. It is something we do almost every day, for much of the day, for decades on end. Because it is so central, looking closely at how much time we spend working can tell us a lot about our lives and the societies we live in.<br><br>As <img src="https://ourworldindata.org/owid-logo.svg" id="owid" width="30" height="20" /> Our world in Data says, In many countries today, people work much less than in the past 150 years. Working less means being able to spend time becoming more educated or simply enjoying leisure time.<br><br>This is substantial progress, but there are still huge inequalities across and within countries, and progress still to make. Taking my home country, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/125px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png" id="cn" width="30" height="22" /> China, as an example, although the country has labor laws, they are in name only. Overtime is very common in <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/125px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png" id="cn" width="30" height="20" /> China, which is also an important aspect why developing countries lag behind developed countries. But relying solely on the efforts of one or two people cannot change anything. Therefore, a consensus must be formed among the whole society, or even all mankind, to change this phenomenon.<br><br>Although many people are unwilling to admit it, the essential operating logic of this world is the <i>LAW OF THE JUNGLE</i>. Covering this core operating logic are various sugar-coatings promoted by politicians, which have different names in different eras. We are used to all kinds of power struggles, all kinds of pan-politicization, and all kinds of populism during the contraction period of the economic cycle, but we still need to forge ahead. In this context, a country that can have a diverse culture, respect the weak, respect women, and be tolerant enough will be respected by more people. Please follow me below.<br><br>Newton said: "If I have seen farther than others, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants." This is how science should work. Those who want to understand the world should be able to stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before. Therefore, I used the data on Our world in Data to visualize the working hours of workers around the world. My work is equivalent to a preliminary work, but we can do some more in-depth research based on this work. For example, discuss why many countries can create high per capita GDP (such as <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" />
Denmark) and have high labor productivity in relatively short working hours. This will be valuable.</h1>

    <h1>BASIC STATS</h1>
    <h2>Since these datasets are already very standardized, almost no data preprocessing is required.<br><br>Dataset Statistics and Key Points from Exploratory Data Analysis:<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg/2048px-Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg.png" id="csv" width="30" height="30" /> Annual Working Hours per Worker:<br>This dataset provides a detailed look at the average annual working hours per worker across various countries and over multiple years. Summary statistics reveal the average, median, and range of working hours, showing significant differences between countries. The data might indicate trends such as decreasing working hours in industrialized countries or highlight differences between economic sectors.<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg/2048px-Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg.png" id="csv" width="30" height="30" /> Annual Working Hours vs GDP per Capita:<br>This dataset links working hours with GDP per capita, offering insights into the economic productivity and labor input across different regions. The exploratory analysis could explore correlations between GDP per capita and working hours, potentially revealing how economic prosperity affects labor practices. A scatter plot of GDP versus working hours would typically show if higher productivity correlates with fewer working hours.<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg/2048px-Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg.png" id="csv" width="30" height="30" /> Productivity vs Annual Hours Worked:<br>Examining the relationship between productivity and annual working hours offers insights into efficiency dynamics within economies. Analysis might show whether shorter working hours correlate with higher productivity, supporting theories about work-life balance and its impact on output. Correlation plots and trend lines could be used to demonstrate these relationships over time and across different economies.</h2>

    <h1>DATA ANALYSIS</h1>
    <h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg/2048px-Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg.png" id="csv" width="30" height="30" /> 1. Annual Working Hours per Worker<br><br>Summary Statistics:<br>Count: There are 3,470 data points in the dataset.<br>Mean: The average annual working hours per worker across all entries is approximately 2005 hours.<br>Standard Deviation: There is a variation of about 304 hours around the mean, indicating a considerable spread in annual working hours across different data entries.<br>Minimum: The shortest annual working hours recorded are about 1354 hours.<br>Maximum: The longest annual working hours recorded are 3483 hours.<br>These statistics indicate a significant range between the minimum and maximum working hours, suggesting diverse working conditions across different countries or regions. The data points to potential differences in labor laws, economic conditions, or cultural norms influencing work hours.<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg/2048px-Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg.png" id="csv" width="30" height="30" /> 2. Annual Working Hours vs GDP per Capita<br><br>Correlation Analysis:<br>The correlation coefficient between annual working hours per worker and GDP per capita is approximately -0.581. This suggests a moderate inverse relationship, meaning as GDP per capita increases, annual working hours tend to decrease.<br>This inverse correlation might imply that higher economic output per person is associated with more efficient work or shorter hours, possibly due to higher labor productivity or more advanced technology.<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg/2048px-Microsoft_Excel_Logo_%282013-2019%29.svg.png" id="csv" width="30" height="30" /> 3. Productivity vs Annual Hours Worked<br><br>Correlation Analysis:<br>The correlation between annual working hours and productivity (output per hour worked) is approximately -0.690. This strong negative correlation further supports the notion that longer working hours are generally not associated with higher productivity.<br>This result suggests that economies with higher productivity tend to have shorter working hours, possibly due to more efficient utilization of labor and better technology.<br>

  <p class="vp1">In this chart, which illustrates the average working hours vs. GDP per capita of different countries in 2019, we can clearly see that for the developed countries on the chart, workers here are more likely to find work-life balance, especially in 2 European countries: Germany and <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark, where workers produce very high Average GDP per capita for very low average annual hours worked.<br>In contrast, for my home country, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/125px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png" id="cn" width="30" height="22" /> China, a developing country -- and the numbers don't lie -- workers often face overtime, but the Average GDP per capita is very low.<br>It's only natural to wonder why the Danes are able to generate so much wealth with such low working hours.<br><br>I learned from denmark.dk:<br><br>In an international context, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark is among the best places to be when it comes to work-life balance, according to the OECD. <br>In <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark, only about 2 % of employees work very long hours compared to the OECD average of 11 %.<br>In <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark, full-time workers devote 66 % of their day on average to personal care and leisure, which is above the OECD average of 63 %.<br><br>Danish women have better opportunities to pursue a career and balance it with family life due to the relatively short working week, flexibility at work, and the supportive network provided by state-subsidised daycare.

I found a convincing answer from a website called Zhihu (which is very similar to the American site Quora):<br><br><img src="assets/img/bulb.png" id="bulb" width="30" height="30" /> Early Human Capital Investments as a Foundation for Economic Success<br><br>Historically, Nordic countries like <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark lacked both abundant capital and a large population base during the early phases of modernization. Unlike countries such as the UK and France, which advanced through industrial and financial means, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark and its neighbors leveraged human capital—the enhancement of knowledge, skills, health, and work autonomy—to catch up. The introduction of compulsory education in <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark as early as 1814, nearly 30 years before Sweden, and pioneering social policies like unemployment security and pension systems, underscores their prioritization of human development over immediate economic growth. Such early investments in human capital allowed <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark to improve national competitiveness and quality of life, setting a solid foundation for future economic stability and growth.<br><br><img src="assets/img/bulb.png" id="bulb" width="30" height="30" /> The Role of High-Quality Labor in Economic Output<br><br>The principle of economic growth can be decomposed into increases in productivity factors, where total output Y is a function of technology and institutional factors A, capital K, and labor L. In this model, labor encompasses not just the quantity of work hours but significantly the quality of the workforce, termed as human capital. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark's strategy focused on enhancing the quality of its labor force, understanding that well-educated, healthy, and freely mobile individuals contribute disproportionately to productivity. Such high-quality labor, even within limited working hours, can generate substantial value, offsetting the need for longer work durations and supporting a high productivity rate.<br><br><img src="assets/img/bulb.png" id="bulb" width="30" height="30" /> Sustaining Economic Growth through Innovation and Welfare<br><br>For an economy to transition to high-quality development, a highly skilled populace is indispensable. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark recognized this early on, ensuring its workforce was well-prepared to capitalize on industrial revolutions and technological advancements. This preparation is evident in <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/225px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png" id="dk" width="30" height="20" /> Denmark's high R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the significant number of researchers per million people, surpassing many larger and richer nations. The emphasis on continuous learning, innovation, and respecting diverse talents within the workforce has fostered an environment conducive to creativity and innovation, crucial for sustained economic growth and development.</p>

    <h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
    <h2>In the data visualization section of the assignment, I attempted to use the Dash library due to the requirement for extensive interactive visual effects. However, using this library necessitated services like Heroku because it cannot directly generate dynamic web pages. Throughout the learning process, I encountered numerous challenges and spent a considerable amount of time resolving them, such as issues with dependencies between libraries and version conflicts. This was a significant learning experience for me.<br><br>I had some experience with CSS from middle school, but it was not extensive. During the creation of the webpage, by interacting with LLM, I acquired a great deal of knowledge, such as how to create parallax scrolling, use anchors, and write JavaScript code.<br><br>As for areas of improvement, firstly, the data set was relatively simple, which limited the choice of visual effects that could be implemented. Secondly, I encountered several challenges in web development that neither GPT nor Copilot could help resolve. Due to time constraints, many issues were not truly solved but were rather bypassed using makeshift solutions. With more time, both the visual effects and the presentation of the webpage could be enhanced significantly.</h2>
